Chair Control Breakout Mini
===========================
Copyright 2018 SuperHouse Automation Pty Ltd <www.superhouse.tv>  
Designed by Jonathan Oxer

Connects between an electric wheelchair input device and the chair
controller, so that the input device can be read by an Arduino and
redirected to another system.

The output can be isolated so that the chair won't receive the input
signals, preventing it from moving while the input is being used for
another purpose such as controlling a computer or remote control
device.

The breakout can send the output to either a connected USB host such
as a computer, or other devices via CAN bus so the wheelchair controls
can be used to fly a drone or drive a remote control car.

Features:

 * 1 x input device connection.
 * 1 x input device pass-through output
 * CAN bus
 * Can derives 12V power from the host wheelchair controller or separately
